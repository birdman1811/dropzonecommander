          Resistance

      The Resistance is a catch all term for groups of humans that have survived Scourge occupation. From the Kalium fleets and armies now allied with the UCM, to survivors that have 
      eeked out an exiistence on the Cradle Worlds since Scourge occupation and the remnants of the Vega scrap fleet, abandoned by both the UCM and the Kalium Kabal. They are skilled survivalists, 
      though their technology is dated, their resilience and gureilla warfare abilities are not to be underestimated. Their hatred for the Scourge knows no bounds.

      <p>Of all the forces encountered by the UCM, the Resistance has changed the most. Initially a ragtag assortment of survivors stranded on the
         Cradle Worlds and Earth, the definition has expanded to encompass all groups that utilise pre-war technology, including the rogue Colony of Kalium.</p>
         <p>Originally, all known Resistance groups were under occupation by the dreaded alien Scourge, remaining at large in the forgotten corners by a combination of luck, 
           guile and the sheer determination to survive in the face of insurmountable odds. Isolated, these societies adapted tenaciously to overcome their own unique 
           circumstances, resulting in a spectrum of cultures from the civilised to the savage. While enlightened leaders strive to uphold liberty, ruthless despots reign through
            merciless cruelty. What separates them from all other combatants is their diversity.</p>
            <p>As the UCMâ€™s Reconquest armadas bring cataclysmic war to Earth and the Cradle Worlds, the oppressed must now stand and fight. The antique war machines and improvised 
              armies of the Resistance are rising - their time has come to do or die.</p>
